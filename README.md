## General Information
- In this application, the user can change any characteristic of the equipment, register a new company to which the equipment belongs, download a .csv file with all the equipment data and know how many equipment belong to a company.
- The reason for developing this application is because it is often difficult for an IT professional to make an inventory of how much equipment there is in the companies they provide services to; to separate, organize and have a list of all equipment in real time.
- The objective of this project is to solve the problem of cataloging equipment and knowing its information during a customer service.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
